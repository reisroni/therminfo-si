<p><h2>Data Description</h2></p><p>The present version of ThermInfo collects information for ca. 3000 organic compounds and includes structural, thermochemical, and bibliographic data.</p><table class="news-Table" cellspacing="15">	<tbody>		<tr>			<th class="tableBG" colspan="2"><strong>General Information</strong><br /></th>		</tr>		<tr>			<th>ThermInfo ID</th>			<td>is a unique and stable identifier for the entity with the format CONNNNNNN (N = digit).</td>		</tr>		<tr>			<th>Compound Name</th>			<td>is the name provided for an entity based on the current recommendations of International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC).</td>		</tr>		<tr>			<th>CAS Registry Number (CASRN)</th>			<td>is a unique numerical identifier created and assigned to a chemical substance by the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS). It does not have any chemical significance and it is assigned in sequential order to assure uniqueness. It has the format NNNNNNN-NN-N (1-7 digits, hyphen, 2 digits, hyphen, 1 digit). The right-most digit is a check digit used to verify the validity and uniqueness of the entire number and it is calculated by taking the last digit times 1, the next digit times 2, the next digit times 3 and so on, adding all these up, and computing the sum modulo 10. For example, the CAS number of methanol is 67-56-1: the checksum 1 is calculated as (6x1 + 5x2 + 7x3 + 6x4) = 61; 61 mod 10 = 1. <a href="http://www.cas.org/expertise/cascontent/registry/regsys.html" title="Information about CASRN">[More Information about CASRN]</a></td>		</tr>		<tr>			<th class="tableBG" colspan="2"><strong>Structural data</strong><br />consist of a set of descriptors that specify the molecular structure of the compounds, showing how the atoms are connected, the molecular size, and other properties.</th>		</tr>		<tr>			<th>Molecular Formula</th>			<td>identifies each constituent element of a compound by its chemical symbol and indicates the number of atoms of each element in subscript after the chemical symbol.

Therefore, the standard molar enthalpy of phase change is simply the difference between the standard molar enthalpies of formation of the substance in the two phases involved. ThermInfo contains values (in kJ/mol) of standard molar enthalpies of fusion (transition from solid to liquid state), vaporization (transition from liquid to gaseous state) and sublimation (transition from solid to gaseous state), at 298.15 K, and their associated uncertainties.</td>		</tr>		<tr>			<th class="tableBG" colspan="2"><strong>Physical Constants</strong><br /></th>		</tr>		<tr>			<th></th>			<td></td>		</tr>		<tr>			<th class="tableBG" colspan="2"><strong>Bibliographic data</strong><br />provide complete references regarding the source of the data, including: author(s), journal/book title, year, volume and page(s).</th>		</tr>	<tbody></table>
